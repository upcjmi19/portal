Began the project with some pieces from one of my previous project. Planning to keep the basic theme of this project to be greenish.
The database's login ID and password can be changed in the file: "root/includes/db.php".
The database uptil today can be created by importing "07_06_2018.sql" file present in the folder "support files".

WORK DONE:
	1. Created the root index.php page
	2. Created the recover.php page that takes loginID and Email, checks if the email is the associated one with the login page. and generates a new password and mails it to the user alongside updating it in the database.

	3. Created two users in the 'loginBase' Table:
			User 		: Password 	: Rank
			15BCS0075 	: 15BCS0075	: 3	
			TPOID0001	: TPOID0001	: 1
